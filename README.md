WikiMap
=========
Created by [Kevin Lee](https://github.com/jhssttj) and [Curtis Wilson](https://github.com/curtis-wils0n) for Lighthouse Labs' full-time web development bootcamp midterm.
> This project is intended to be a proof of concept, and therefore should not be hosted or used as a stand-alone website.

## Summary

üó∫Ô∏èüß≠ **WikiMap** is a bold, easy-to-use social map-making website that allows users to create, edit, and share custom maps with friends.

![](https://github.com/curtis-wils0n/midterm-project/blob/styling-tests/images/splash-example.png?raw=true)

WikiMap utilizes Sass, Ajax, and jQuery calls to display front-end content, while Node, Express, and PostgreSQL operate the back-end.

Design was inspired by neubrutalist sites such as [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), and [Pizza Pizza Design Services](https://pizzapizza.io/)

## Screenshots

Users can access a list of diverse and creative maps.

Contibute to existing maps by placing pins, or create your own map to gather input from others!

Each individual marker can hold detailed information about its location.
