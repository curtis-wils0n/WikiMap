WikiMap
=========
Created by [Kevin Lee](https://github.com/jhssttj) and [Curtis Wilson](https://github.com/curtis-wils0n) for Lighthouse Labs' full-time web development bootcamp midterm.
> This project is intended to be a proof of concept, and therefore should not be hosted or used as a stand-alone website.

## Summary

üó∫Ô∏èüß≠ **WikiMap** is a bold, easy-to-use social map-making website that allows users to create, edit, and share custom maps with friends.

![](https://github.com/curtis-wils0n/midterm-project/blob/styling-tests/images/splash-example.png?raw=true)

WikiMap utilizes Sass, Ajax, and jQuery calls to display front-end content, while Node, Express, and PostgreSQL operate the back-end.

Design was inspired by neubrutalist sites such as [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), and [Pizza Pizza Design Services](https://pizzapizza.io/)
