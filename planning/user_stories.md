# User Stories for Wiki Map

As a user, I want to be able to...
- ...*create* interactable maps with other authenticated users, *because* I want to share and see other people's opinions
- ...*create* private maps that only I can edit, *because* I want a personal reminder of places I want to go
- ...*create* a map with multiple points, *because* I want these locations to be categorized by a common theme
- ...*create* a point on a map with a title, description, and image, *because* it gives me a better idea of what the location is
- ...*create* a profile where I can display my favourite maps and people can see public maps that I've contributed to, *because* I like to be social
- ...*edit* maps that I have access too, *because* I might change my mind
- ...*see* a list of viewable maps, *because* I want to explore new places
- ...*view* a single map, *because* I want to see more details (i.e., what the map was created for)
- ...*save* maps I want to come back to, *because* I might need to refer to it in the future
